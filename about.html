<h1>About</h1>

<p1>Name: Daniel Newcomer <br> Date:4/25/2021 <br> CIS155 <br>This is V1 of my "What's Your Ride?" site. Added this version was the index, or home page, and the about page. Additionally there is a styles.css page which gives both pages background color as well as font and text color. The home page has navigation to the about page, as well as several placeholders for future pages that will be added. There is one photo (that desperately needs resized) on the home page. </p>

<p>I am using a psedu element here to change the first line if text, but not the rest of the code will remain the same color.</p>
